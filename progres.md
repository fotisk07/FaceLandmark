# Progression

## Initial setup

- Working dataset : OK
- Basic transforms to fix image size : OK
- Basic MLP baseline : OK for code but checking is necessary
  - Starting training, val loss : 16392
  - Train loss : 69505 | Val loss: 35463 after 1 epoch ...
- Check up the MLP is doing smth : Done
- Scale the model, is the loss decreasing ? Add convolutions : Done

Right now we are at 40 loss

Last steps :

- Save model if good : OK
- Show some visuals : OK
- Improve the config a bit : OK

## Advanced

- More transforms : OK Should check performance increase
- Crop faces for less sparsity : TODO
- Better input/output with masks : TODO
