# Progression

## Initial setup

- Working dataset : OK
- Basic transforms to fix image size : OK
- Basic MLP baseline : OK for code but checking is necessary
  - Starting training, val loss : 16392
  - Train loss : 69505 | Val loss: 35463 after 1 epoch ...
- Check up the MLP is doing smth : TODO
- Scale the model, is the loss decreasing ? Add convolutions : TODO

## Advanced

- Crop faces for less sparsity : TODO
- Better input/output with masks : TODO
